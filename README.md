## Installation

```bash

(Your project will benefit from the installation of some base libraries that enhance your development environment. Run the command npm install -D http-server html-validate prettier in your terminal. This command installs http-server for serving your HTML files locally, html-validate for ensuring your HTML is error-free and adheres to standards, and prettier for formatting your code to maintain readability and consistency.)

Start the development server: npm start
The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
